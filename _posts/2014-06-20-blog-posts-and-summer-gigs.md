I have recently heard complaints that this blog is [rather quiet lately](http://www.stackdriver.com/top-devops-influencers-blogs-follow/). I agree. I have definitely been focused on publishing through other sources and have found little time to write interesting things here. On the one hand, I find twitter ideal for communicating quick and short ideas, thoughts, or pointers. You should definitely [follow me](http://www.twitter.com/xamat) there if you want to keep up to date. On the other hand, I have published a couple of posts on the [Netflix Techblog](http://techblog.netflix.com/). A few months ago we published a post describing [our three-tier system architecture](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/system-architectures-for.html) for personalization and recommendations. More recently we described our implementation of [distributed Neural Networks](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/02/distributed-neural-networks-with-gpus.html) using GPUs and the AWS cloud.

The other thing I continue on doing very often is give talks of our work at different events and venues. In the last few months, for instance, I have given talks at LinkedIn, Facebook, and [Stanford](http://i.stanford.edu/infoseminar/).

This week I gave a talk and attended the Workshop on Algorithms for Modern Massive Datasets ([MMDS](http://mmds-data.org/)). This is a very interesting workshop organized by [Michael Mahoney](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) every two years. It brings together a diverse crowd of people, from theoretical physicist and statisticians to industry practicioners. All of them are united by their work on large scale data-driven algorithms. You can find the slides of my presentation [here](http://www.slideshare.net/xamat/mmds-2014-talk-distributing-ml-algorithms-from-gpus-to-the-cloud).

So, what is next? If you want to catch some of my future talks, I will be giving a couple of public ones in the next few months.

First, I will be lecturing in the Machine Learning Summer School ([MLSS](http://www.mlss2014.com/)) at CMU in early July. I am really looking forward to joining such a great least of speakers and visiting Pittsburgh for the first time. I will be lecturing on Recommendation Systems and Machine Learning Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering.

Late August I will be giving a 3 hour long [Tutorial](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2014/tutorials.html) at KDD in New York. The tutorial is entitled “The Recommender Problem Revisited” and I will be sharing stage with [Bamshad Mobasher](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/people/pages/facultyinfo.aspx?fid=653).

Finally, I was recently notified that a shorter version of the same tutorial has been accepted at [Recsys](http://recsys.acm.org/recsys14/), which this year is held in the Silicon Valley.

I look forward to meeting many of you in any of these events. Don’t hesitate to ping me if you will be attending.

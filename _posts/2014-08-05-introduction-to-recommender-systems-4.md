A couple of weeks ago, I gave a 4 hour lecture on Recommender Systems at the [2014 Machine Learning Summer School at CMU](http://mlss2014.com/index.html). The school was organized by Alex Smola and Zico Kolter and, judging by the attendance and the quality of the speakers, it was a big success. This is the outline of my lecture:

1. Introduction: What is a Recommender System
2. “Traditional” Methods
* Collaborative Filtering
* Content-based Recommendations
3. “Novel” Methods
* Learning to Rank
* Context-aware Recommendations
 * Tensor Factorization
 * Factorization Machines
4. Deep Learning
5. Similarity<
6. Social Recommendations
7. Hybrid Approaches
8. A practical example: Netflix 
9. Conclusions
10. References

You can access the slides in Slideshare and the videos in Youtube, but I thought it would make sense to gather both here and link them together.

Here are the slides:

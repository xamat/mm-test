That was the main title of a series of talks I gave in different labs and companies during my recent California tour. In this presentation, I talked about many of our recent projects related to how to interpret user feedback, in general, and in the particular case of recommender systems. I talked about our work on [measuring user rating noise](http://localhost:8080/wordpress/2009/04/i-like-it-i-like-it-not-or-how-miss.html), our follow-up in devising [algorithms to reduce this natural noise](http://localhost:8080/wordpress/2009/08/rate-it-again.html), and on how you can use[ experts instead of crowds](http://localhost:8080/wordpress/2009/05/wisdom-of-few.html) to not only minimize this noise but address other issues in collaborative filtering.

I also gave a sneak preview of our results to the[ music survey](http://localhost:8080/wordpress/2010/08/study-on-online-music-taste-call-for.html) I announced some time ago. [Denis Parra](http://www.sis.pitt.edu/%7Edparra/) and I have submitted this work recently and are hoping to get it accepted to tell you a bit more about how to map implicit to explicit feedback.

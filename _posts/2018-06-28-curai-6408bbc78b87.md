I haven’t updated this channel in a while. I hope that by now you have already found out elsewhere that about a year ago I co-founded a company in the AI/Healthcare space: [Curai](https://www.curai.com). A few weeks back, we came out of stealth so I thought it would be interesting to do a quick post gathering some of the resources that can help you understand what we are up to.

Before I do that, let me quickly summarize who we are and what we are up to. The three co-founders are Neil Hunt, former Chief Product Officer at Netflix of 18 years, Neal Khosla, Stanford CS/Math graduate with strong ties to the startup/entrepreneurship scene, and myself. We have gathered a terrific team of engineers, AI and product experts from companies like Facebook, Google, or Netflix. Our mission is “Scaling the world’s best healthcare to every human being”. We are using artificial intelligence / machine learning with a user-centric focus to provide instant medical expertise that is accurate, trustworthy, relevant, and actionable. We will be unveiling more details about our product and technology in the future, but please do reach out to me if you want to learn more than what you will find in the resources below.

A good follow up to the paragraph above with more details about who we are is our foundational [blog post](https://medium.com/curai/using-ai-ml-to-scale-the-worlds-best-healthcare-to-every-human-being-8cbc56df21d6).

You might also be interested to read about our Series-A founding in this [Techcrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/curai-picks-up-10-7m-to-create-a-smarter-system-to-help-patients-supply-the-best-info-for-their-doctors/).

If you want to start getting a bit more technical, [this video] (https://youtu.be/N9D60zDUr48) introduces the space and some of the challenges we are tackling in the intersection of ML/AI and medicine:

One particular aspect that we are focusing on is the design of a conversational engine for medicine. [These slides](https://www.slideshare.net/xamat/learning-to-speak-medicine) from my most recent talk introduce some of the latest research in this space.

Finally, I am happy to say that a year after starting the company, we have already had our first paper accepted to a conference, the Machine Learning for Healthcare conference (MLHC). You can read [the preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08033) on ArxiV.

We are growing strong and adding engineers, ML/AI researchers, physicians, and medical informaticists. Please reach out to me if you’d like to hear more about it.
